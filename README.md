## Workflow

Standups were held every morning, allowing each group member to outline achievements from the previous day and anything that was blocking their progress. Plans for the upcoming day were set and work was allocated. 

Sprints were two days long with a planning session at the start. A retro was held at the end to discuss what had gone well and what could be improved on.

Pull requests were reviewed by other members of the team who had not been working on the code before it was merged to master. This ensured errors were caught and that all members of the group were aware of the whole codebase.
